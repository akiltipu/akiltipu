Hello, I'm **Akil Mahmod Tipu**, a DevOps engineer with the ability to fully automate the code-to-production workflow.

Cloud platforms, infrastructure as code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines are areas in which I have a track record of success. A wide range of DevOps tools and technologies, such as Linux, Gradle, NPM, Prometheus, SonarQube, Grafana, GitPod, Terraform, Jenkins, Git, Ansible, and AWS, are among those in which I am proficient. Also proficient in scripting languages such as Bash and Python.

Automation, continuous delivery, and continuous integration are the main areas of focus in my comprehensive understanding of DevOps practices and principles.

Finding new methods to enhance the software development process is something I am constantly interested in doing, as I have a strong desire to learn and share knowledge and am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team.

If you are looking for a DevOps engineer who can help you achieve your goals, I encourage you to contact me. I would be happy to discuss your needs in more detail.
